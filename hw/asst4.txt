1) A shellcode is just any arbitrary piece of code that the attacker will run when exploiting a software.

2) A NOP sled is a series of No-op instructions that are placed before your shellcode, in the stack. This is useful when it is unknown where exactly the function will return to on the stack.

3) A gadget is a short series of assembly instruction that ends in ret. These can be chained together to execute arbitrary code.

4) 
1. Database firewalls will filter out suspicious queries from being executed, based on how many invalid queries the host sent.
2. Parametrized statements can be used to insert variables in queries instead of appending the entire user input to the query. This will reject arbitrary SQL fragments.
3. Escaping any special characters in the input can prevent input from being interpreted as SQL queries.
4. Use pattern checking to see if the format of the input matches the expected data type.
