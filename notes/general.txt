CIA triad
1) Confidentiality       Keep data & resources hidden
                         hide the fact that communication is happening

Privacy             limit sharing of info, control how ur information is used
                    This is why we want Confidentiality
Secrecy             ability to send messages so no one else can see
                    used to implement Confidentiality

ex- not everyone should have access to rutgers servers

2) Integrity           
Types of Integrity
- Data = data is not changed
- Origin = data is authenticated from the correct source
- System = Does everything work as expected? Make sure system was not infiltrated

ex- sign in with netid

3) Availability
Being able to use system or resources
Ddos attack
firewall, OS resource management, backups, etc...

ex- servers shouldn't go down

policy = what is or isn't allowed
mechanism = impl. and enforce policies



disclosure = unauthorized access to data, snooping
deception = accepting false data, injecting data
disruption = interrupting correct operation, Ddos
usurpation = unauthorized control of system


fan = fz110@rutgers.edu
wed 3-5, core 331t

TCB = trusted computing base
components that are imp. to security

=================================

policy = what to achieve
mechanism = cipher, access control, policy implementation
assurance = how much you can rely on one part of system
incentive = incentive for defenders to defend and attackers to attack

Security theatre = showing off high security instead of implementing
effective mechanisms. Provides feeling of security

principal = entity that participates in security system
            person, equipment, communications channel
            subcomponent of a system
            principal can also be a combination of other principals
subject = person, can also be a principal (person can be part of a system)
group = set of principals
role = functions assumed by persons
