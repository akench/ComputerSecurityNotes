Question 1:
A security theatre is when an organization just puts on the appearance 
of having a secure system rather than actually implementing effective mechanisms
to mitigate security vulnerabilities. This causes users to FEEL like there is
improved security, but does not have any concrete security benefits.


Question 2:
A principal is just an entity (a subcomponent) in a security system. This can include
people, piece of equipment, communications channels, or a combination of other principals. 
On the other hand, a subject is a physical person such as a human, or it can include
a legal entity such as a government. 


Question 3:
A trusted system is any system which if it fails, has the ability to compromise the 
security of the system. A trustworthy system is a system which we can trust to never fail
and to always keep the system secure. 


Question 4:
1) Problem of anonymity = With the way the internet was designed, it is really easy to stay 
                        anonymous, making it easier for attackers to stay hidden.
2) Difficulty of distinction = It is hard to distinguish different types of attacks before they
                        are actually executed.
3) Power asymmetries = Small nations with a tiny military can use cyber warfare to attack larger powers.


Question 5:
Scams with a miniscule chance of success are still deployed because it costs the scammer
almost nothing to send out the email messages. Enough people must fall for the scams that 
the scammer is making a profit.


Question 6:
Policy = What is supposed to be achieved (which security vulnerability should be mitigated?)
Mechanism = The means of executing the policy (things like ciphers and access control)
Assurance = How much you can rely on a part of the mechanism to work properly
Incentive = The incentive for defenders of the security system to properly defend, and the
            incentive for attackers to gain access to the system
