Question 1:
a) chmod 006 testfile
b) I cannot access the file because it is only accessible by members not in the group (other), and I am in the group.
c) I can delete the file beause I have write access to the parent directory.

Question 2:
a) Compressing the users means you should compact the Access control matrix by using groups to manage the permissions of many users together, reducing the number of rows in the matrix.
b) Compressing the rights means you should split up the columns into ACLs, which specify the permissions for only the given resource, or into capabilties, which specify permissions for the user.

Question 3:
1. Since the system admin has root access, he can modify any file on the system, making it difficult to keep a secure audit trail
2. There is no easy way to implement access triplets (user,program,file)
3. ACL are not good at representing mutable state
4. Unix ACL only contains one user, so programmers often end up giving their programs too many permissions

Question 4.
a) The simple security property is that a process cannot read data that is of higher confidentiality. This is to maintain data confidentiality.
b) *-property is that a process cannot write data to a lower confidentiality level. This is to maintain data integrity.
