1) Perfect secrecy means there is no way to observe any patterns in the cipher text to find out the plain text.
2) Robert hooke sorted all the letters of his theorem into alphabetical order. This is a one way function because there is no way to know what the original text was, with 100% certainty.
3)  1. Hash functions are one-way functions. 
    2. Hash function output should give 0 information about input
    3. If the output is long enough, hash collisions are very unlikely.

4) A trapdoor one-way permutation is a computation that anyone can perform, but can only be reversed using the secret key.

5) Confusion is adding unknown key values and diffusion is spreading the data in the plaintext throughout the entire ciphertext.
6) An S-box is a lookup table used to transform (substitute) input bits into output bits.
